## About Me

I am a Professor of Mathematics at Yale University. 
My research interests lie in geometric analysis and differential geometry, with a particular focus on geometric flows -- such as mean curvature flow and Ricci flow -- and minimal surfaces.

I previously held faculty positions at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin--Madison. 
I have also been a visiting researcher at the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath, formerly MSRI) and the Institute for Advanced Study.

I earned a B.S. in 2006 from Peking University and a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2011 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I was advised by Tobias H. Colding.
I completed my postdoctoral training at SLMath, Johns Hopkins University, and Imperial College London.
