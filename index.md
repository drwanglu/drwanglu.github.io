## About Me

I am a Professor of Mathematics at Yale University. 
My research interests lie in geometric analysis and differential geometry, with a particular focus on geometric flows -- such as mean curvature flow and Ricci flow -- and minimal surfaces.

I previously held faculty positions at Caltech and the University of Wisconsin--Madison. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT in 2011, under the supervision of [Tobias H. Colding](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=50).
I completed my postdoctoral training at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI, now SLMath), Johns Hopkins University, and Imperial College London.
